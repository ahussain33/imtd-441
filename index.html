            <h1>Abiha Hussain</h1>
            <p>My name is Abiha. I am a third year ITM major/coterminal student. My hope from this class is to get me more familarized with front-end development. I know we will be going more indepth with JavaScript so I am excited for that. The following will be a quick summary of me and my experience at IIT.</p>

        <h2>Experience with Web Development</h2>
        <p>My hope for this class is to get familiar with industry standards like git and any other software used in web development. Currently, I know the basics of HTML/CSS and JavaScript; however, I am looking to become more advanced in my JS skills</p>
        <p>Currently, I am in my third year of the ITM program. My specialization is in web development. I hope to become a web developer on the front-end.</p>
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>As for work experience, I work at the Galvin library at the front desk, scanning in any books patrons want to check out. I also intern at the City of Chicago Department of Housing. Some of the things I am responsible for are updating the DOH page with any current information. The city uses Adobe Experience Manager to host their website, so there isn't much coding involved in that.</p>
        <p>I am a commuter student that lives in the Chicago neighborhood of West Ridge. Its neighborhood is located pretty far north, right next to Rogers Park. I also did grow up in that neighborhood and have been living there since I was born. Some things that I like doing for fun include taking long walks and listening to music.</p>
